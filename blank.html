        <h1>Why I fly fish</h1>
        <p> I started fly fishing when I was about 12 years old with my dad, and it has been something I constantly think of since then. It has been more than a hobby, it is my escape. There is something quite therapuetic about it, that draws me to the river day in and day out.</p>
        <p> It was also a great way for my Dad and I to spend time together. As a teenager, it pulled me away from my phone as we would often be in remote places, and helped me build a more meaninggul relationship with my Dad. This is one of the greatest gifts Fly Fishing has given me, and continues to give me.</p>

                    <h3><li>The Livingstone: Alberta Canada</li></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Livingstone is a beautiful river that runs through the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada. It is known for its crystal-clear waters and stunning scenery. The river is home to a variety of fish species, including rainbow trout and cutthroat trout. The Livingstone is a great river for fly fishing, as it offers opportunities for anglers of all skill levels.</li>
                        <li>Most importantly, it is where I learned to fish, and therefore holds the most sentimental value.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The areas surrounding the Missouri River in Montana offer some of the best fly fishing experiences in the United States. Known for its diverse fish population, including massive browns and bows, the Missouri provides anglers with both challenging and rewarding fishing opportunities.</li>
                        <li>This river had been on my bucketlist for the longest time, and I finally got to fish it right before I left on my mission in 2022; it did not dissapoint</li>

                    <h3><li>The Bitterroot: Montana USA</li></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Bitterroot River in Montana is renowned for its exceptional fly fishing opportunities. With its clear waters and abundant insect life, the river supports a healthy population of trout, making it a favorite destination for anglers seeking both trophy fish and scenic beauty.</li>
                        <li>It is not one of large size, but it is full of fun. A good float day on the Bitteroot chasing rising cuttys is some of the most fun you will have with a fly rod</li>

        <h2 id="bucketlist">Still to do...</h2>
        <p>There is still plenty of rivers and streams I want to explore and fish, but there is one place in particular that has caught my attention. It is only accessible by float plane as it is nestled in rugged northern British Columbia, in a place called spatsizi. Check out this video:</p>
